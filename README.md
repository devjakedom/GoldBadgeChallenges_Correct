# GoldBadgeChallenges_Correct
challenge one is an app for a menu that allows the cafe manager to add, delete, and see all items in the menu list.

challenge 2 is an app for claims that allows a claims manager to manage items in a list of claims.

challenge 3 is an app that maintains a dictionary of details about employee badge information. 

the claim file is supposed to be ChallengeOneRepository but i accidently typed the wrong thing when creating and fixed it on vs code but i it still shows as claim


I hope i dont fail. im confident in my work but its 3am the morning its due and im just beyond stress and want a new week to start. i will be adding on more challenges as i do them
